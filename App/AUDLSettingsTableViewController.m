Open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click News. All the most recent AUDL headlines will be right there!\n\nWhere can I find out more about a specific team that I like?\n\nThe Teams section! Open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Teams. Here, you’ll find a complete listing of every team in the AUDL. Click on any one of them to find out more about their players and their upcoming games!\n\nIf I want to see what the AUDL is saying at this instant, where do I go?\n\nWe made the Now section just for you. Open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Now. The 20 most recent tweets made by the AUDL will always be here. Just revisit the page every time you want to refresh!\n\nCan I watch games on the AUDL Mobile App?\n\nYes you can! Some games are recorded and released onto YouTube for public viewing. We have these games, along with promo vids, rules reviews, and other things all in our Videos section. All you have to do is open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Videos. Then watch as many games you’d like! Caution: Standard data rates apply.\n\nI’m a stats fan. Where can I go to find out who the best players are?\n\nIf you’re interested in stats about a specific team, check out the Teams section. Otherwise, if you want to see the best players in each major stats category, Open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Statistics. Here, you can find out who ranks the best in everything from Drops, D’s, to PMC’s!\n\nI want to see where the teams stand at this point in the season, where do I go?\n\nThe Standings page does exactly what it sounds like – it shows you where all the AUDL teams stand at this very moment in the season. Simply open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Standings. From here, slide sideways to check out the current standings for each division.\n\nI missed out on a few games in the last couple weeks.

Remember, if a game hasn’t been played yet, the scores will sometimes be marked 0-0. I mean, has a game ever had 0 points on either side?\n\nI’m interested in finding out who the best player is on a particular team. Where can I go?\n\nWell, it’s hard to say who’s the best player all around, but the team stats provides a little bit of insight into this question. Open up the app’s navigation menu by clicking on the AUDL Logo at the top left corner of your screen (or slide right from the left edge of your screen) and click Teams. From here, select the team of your interest, and then slide through the tabs in the screen until you get to the stats tab. Here, you’ll get to see the best ranked players within a particular team in each stats category.\n\nI don’t know anything about Ultimate Frisbee. Is there a place for me to go?\n\nOf course! Just open up your browser, and go to http://theaudl.com/about/ultimate. Here, you’ll find some basic info about how gameplay works. If you’re less initiated, just hang tight, version 3 of this mobile app will have rules along with the FAQ!\n\nI hate this mobile app, who can I talk to about this abomination?\n\nWe’re extremely sorry for any inconvenience the AUDL mobile app may have caused you. Our development team is actively upgrading our application, and we’d love to hear any suggestions you may have for us on how we could improve.

Indemnification\n\nUpon our request, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, and our subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners and employees, from and against all liabilities, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of any of Your Content that you submit, post to or transmit through the Services, your use of the Services, your use of any Modular Content, your violation of this Agreement or your violation of any rights of another.\n\n16. Choice of Law and Forum\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, for matters not susceptible of adjudication in the federal courts, the courts of the State of New York located in New York County, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Services.\n\n17. United States Jurisdiction\n\nThe Services are operated out of the United States of America. We do not represent that content or materials presented on the Services are appropriate (or, in some case, unavailable) for use in other locations. If you access the Services from a jurisdiction other than the United States, you agree that you do so on your own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable to your use of the Services.\n\n18. Severability and Integration\n\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and governs your use of the Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. This agreement may be modified only by our posting on the Services changes to this Agreement, or by a subsequent writing signed by us.\n\n19. No Waiver\n\nOur failure to enforce any provisions of this Agreement or to respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of this Agreement or to act with respect to similar breaches.\n\n20. No Professional Advice\n\nAny information supplied by any of our employees or agents, whether by telephone, e-mail, letter, facsimile or other form of communication, is intended solely as general guidance on the use of the Services, and does not constitute legal, tax, accounting or other professional advice. Individual situations and state laws vary and users are encouraged to obtain appropriate advice from qualified professionals in the applicable jurisdictions. We make no representations or warranties concerning any course of action taken by any person following or otherwise using the information offered or provided within or through the Services, and we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or other damages that may result, including but not limited to economic loss, injury, illness or death.\n\n21. Miscellaneous\n\nYou agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Services. Nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\n\n21. Termination\n\nWe reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement and your access to all or part of the Services, with or without notice and with or without cause. Termination of your access to the Services means the revocation of the limited and temporary license and permission to use the software and other resources of the Services we are granting to you under this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement will survive the termination of your access to the Services and of this Agreement. In addition, because the license you grant to us in Your Content is perpetual, termination of this agreement does not terminate our license to use Your Content as described elsewhere in these Terms of Use.\n\n22. Notices\n\nAt our option, we may give notices to users of the Services by posting a message on the Service, by electronic or conventional mail or by any other means by which users obtain actual knowledge thereof. Any notices you give to us must be by electronic or conventional mail. Any notices you send to us by electronic mail must be sent to audlappdevteam@gmail.com. Any notice by you to us will not change the terms of this Agreement unless the change is expressly accepted in writing by one of our authorized officers.\n\n23. Violations\n\nPlease report any violations of this Agreement to audlappdevteam@gmail.com.";
