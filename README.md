Testing:
  To run our unit tests, the steps within Jon Reid’s read me file need to be followed. These short instructions describe how to install and execute his code coverage suite with our app and app testing suite. Once installed, all that needs to be done is to choose Product->Test from the menu drop down of Xcode. This will run our tests on our app’s code. Then running the command ./getcov in the terminal from the current working directory will perform the analysis and eventually display the results in a web browser.
